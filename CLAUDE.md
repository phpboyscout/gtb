# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Workflows

The `.agent/` directory contains the primary execution mechanisms for this project. Always prefer these over ad-hoc steps.

| Task | Workflow / Skill |
|------|-----------------|
| Any development or maintenance work | Read `.agent/skills/gtb-dev/SKILL.md` first |
| Drafting a new feature specification | `/gtb-spec` |
| Adding or modifying a reusable library component in `pkg/` | `/gtb-library-contribution` |
| Defining or generating a new CLI command | `/gtb-command-generation` |
| Verifying correctness before committing or raising a PR | `/gtb-verify` |
| Resolving golangci-lint issues | `/gtb-lint` |
| Updating documentation without touching code | `/gtb-docs` |
| Preparing or validating a release | `/gtb-release` |

## Development Lifecycle

### Step 0: Spec Check (Before Any Implementation)

**Do not write implementation code until this is complete.**

1. Check `docs/development/specs/` for an existing spec matching the feature.
2. Only proceed if the spec status is `APPROVED` or `IN PROGRESS`.
3. For **non-trivial features** (new packages, public API changes, generator modifications, architectural changes) with no existing spec: run `/gtb-spec` to draft one, save it to `docs/development/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md` with status `DRAFT`, then pause for human review.
4. For **quick fixes and minor changes** (bug fixes, small refactors that don't alter the public API): proceed directly.
5. Update spec status to `IN PROGRESS` when starting, `IMPLEMENTED` when done.

### Implementation (TDD)

- Write failing tests first, derived from the spec's public API, error cases, and edge cases.
- Implement the minimum code to pass. Refactor. Re-run tests.
- Use `github.com/cockroachdb/errors` for all error creation and wrapping — `go-errors/errors` has been removed.
- New `pkg/` features must have **≥90% test coverage**.
- Never add `//nolint` decorators — always address the root cause.

### Library-First

New features must be implemented in `pkg/` as a reusable component before being exposed via the CLI. When modifying library APIs that affect scaffolded output, also update templates in `internal/generator/`.

### After Implementation

1. Run `/gtb-verify` (tests, race detector, lint, mocks).
2. If generator output was affected: `just build && go run ./cmd/gtb generate <command> -p tmp`, verify `tmp/`, delete it.
3. Update `docs/components/` and `docs/concepts/` — any functional change **must** include a doc update, cross-referenced with the code for accuracy.
4. Run `/simplify` on changed files before raising a PR.

## Commands

This project uses `just` as the task runner:

```bash
just              # Default: tidy, generate, build binary to bin/gtb
just test         # Unit tests with coverage
just test-race    # Race condition detection
just test-integration  # Integration tests (requires INT_TEST=true tag)
just lint         # Run golangci-lint
just lint-fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
just mocks        # Regenerate mocks via mockery
just ci           # Full local CI: tidy, generate, test, test-race, lint
just coverage     # HTML coverage report
just generate     # go generate ./...
just snapshot     # Local goreleaser snapshot build (output to dist/)
just cleanup      # Remove build artifacts
```

Run a single test:
```bash
go test ./pkg/props/... -run TestSpecificName -v
```

## Commit Conventions

All commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Semantic-release uses these to determine version bumps.

**Do not commit without explicit user approval.** Present a summary of changes and a proposed message, then wait for confirmation.

**Do not add AI attribution** — no `Co-Authored-By:` trailers naming an AI, no references to AI assistance in commit messages. The committing developer owns the change entirely.

| Type | Release |
|------|---------|
| `feat(scope):` | Minor |
| `fix(scope):` / `perf(scope):` / `refactor(scope):` | Patch |
| `ci:` / `chore:` / `style:` / `docs:` / `test:` | None |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | Major |

Always include a scope identifying the functional area (package name, subsystem, feature). Each commit represents one coherent change.

## Architecture

**go-tool-base (GTB)** is a framework for building Go CLI tools and services. It provides a reusable, opinionated base with AI integration, self-updating, service lifecycle management, and interactive TUI components.

### Dependency Injection: Props Container

The central pattern is the `Props` struct in `pkg/props/`. Every command receives a `Props` instance containing:
- `Logger` — logging backend
- `Config` — Viper-based configuration
- `Assets` — embedded assets (default configs, templates)
- `FS` — `afero.Fs` for testable filesystem access
- `ErrorHandler` — structured user-facing error reporting
- `Tool` — tool metadata (name, release source for updates)
- `Version` — runtime/ldflags version info

Narrow provider interfaces (`LoggerProvider`, `ConfigProvider`, etc.) allow packages to declare only the dependencies they need.

### Command Architecture (Cobra)

Commands are built on Cobra. The root command in `pkg/cmd/root/` wires Props, loads config, and registers global `PersistentPreRunE` middleware for: config loading, log level setup, feature flag resolution, and update checks.

**Feature flags** control which built-in commands are active:
```go
props.SetFeatures(
    props.Disable(props.InitCmd),
    props.Enable(props.AiCmd),
)
```
Default-enabled: `UpdateCmd`, `InitCmd`, `McpCmd`, `DocsCmd`, `DoctorCmd`.

The binary entry point is `cmd/gtb/main.go`. The `internal/cmd/` packages add GTB-specific commands (`generate`, `regenerate`, `remove`) for scaffolding new CLI tools based on this framework.

### Configuration

`pkg/config/` wraps Viper with hierarchical merging (precedence: CLI flags > env vars > file config > embedded assets > defaults). Hot-reload supported via the `Observable` interface.

### AI Chat Client

`pkg/chat/` provides a unified multi-provider client:
- Providers: Anthropic Claude, Claude Local (CLI binary), OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Google Gemini
- Core interface: `ChatClient` (Add, Chat, Ask, SetTools)
- ReAct loop orchestration with automatic tool calling and JSON Schema parameter definitions

### Service Lifecycle (Controls)

`pkg/controls/` orchestrates long-running services with startup ordering, health monitoring, and graceful shutdown. Two transports:
- `pkg/grpc/` — gRPC for remote management
- `pkg/http/` — health/readiness/management HTTP endpoints

### Error Handling

`pkg/errorhandling/` wraps `cockroachdb/errors` with user-facing hints (`WithHint`/`WithHintf`), help channel config (Slack/Teams), and stack traces in debug mode.

### Code Generation

`internal/generator/` uses `dave/dst` and `dave/jennifer` for AST-level Go code generation. The `generate`/`regenerate`/`remove` commands scaffold new CLI tools that extend this framework.

### Testing

- Mocks live in `mocks/` and are generated by mockery.
- Integration tests use the `//go:build integration` tag and require `INT_TEST=true`.
- Table-driven tests with `t.Parallel()` is the standard pattern.
- Use `logger.NewNoop()` for test loggers.

## Linting

Config in `.golangci.yaml` (v2 format, 50+ linters). Local import prefix: `github.com/phpboyscout/go-tool-base`. Disabled linters: `perfsprint`, `wrapcheck`, `wsl`.

**Lint resolution order** (simplest to most complex): `errcheck` → `gocritic` → `staticcheck` → `exhaustive` → `nestif` → `cyclop`. Run tests after every structural fix.

## Release

Releases are automated via semantic-release on merge to `main` — do not manually tag. GoReleaser (`.goreleaser.yaml`) builds for darwin/linux/windows × amd64/arm64 with CGO disabled and FIPS mode. macOS binaries are notarized; a Homebrew formula is auto-updated.

Pre-release: run `just ci`, then `goreleaser check`, then `just snapshot` to verify `dist/` output.
