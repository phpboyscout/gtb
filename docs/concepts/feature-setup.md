# Feature Setup & Registry

GTB uses a modular setup and registration pattern to decouple core framework logic from domain-specific features. This allows applications like `als` to scale by adding new capabilities without modifying the central root command or initialization flow.

## The Feature Registry

The `FeatureRegistry` (found in `pkg/setup/registry.go`) acts as a central clearinghouse for features to announce their presence. It manages three types of contributions:

1.  **Initialisers**: Code that runs during the `init` command to configure a feature.
2.  **Subcommands**: Cobra commands that should be added to the CLI hierarchy.
3.  **Flags**: Global or command-specific flags that a feature requires.

### Self-Registration

Features register themselves using the `Register` function, typically called from a feature's package `init()` function or a high-level command constructor.

```go
func init() {
    setup.Register(
        props.FeaturePipeline, // The unique feature identifier
        []setup.InitialiserProvider{NewPipelineInitialiser},
        []setup.SubcommandProvider{NewPipelineCommands},
        nil, // No specific command flags
    )
}
```

## The Initialiser Interface

For features that require interactive setup (like configuring API keys or local paths), the `Initialiser` interface provides a standardized contract:

```go
type Initialiser interface {
    Name() string
    IsConfigured(cfg config.Containable) bool
    Configure(p *props.Props, cfg config.Containable) error
}
```

- **`IsConfigured`**: Checks the existing configuration to see if setup can be skipped.
- **`Configure`**: Executes the interactive setup (often using `huh` or prompt libraries) and populates the configuration container.

## The Init Workflow

When a user runs the `init` command, the `setup.Initialise` function performs the following steps:

1.  **Bootstrap**: Creates the default config directory and base `config.yaml`.
2.  **Merge Assets**: Loads any domain-specific configuration templates from the `Assets` layer.
3.  **Discovery**: Retrieves all registered `InitialiserProvider` functions from the `globalRegistry`.
4.  **Execution**: Iterates through each initialiser, checking if it's already configured and running the `Configure` step if necessary.
5.  **Persistence**: Writes the final, merged configuration back to disk.

## Why use this pattern?

- **Decoupling**: The core `root` and `init` commands don't need to know about every possible feature. They simply iterate through what has been registered.
- **Scalability**: Adding a new feature is as simple as creating a new package that calls `setup.Register`.
- **Consistency**: All features follow the same setup and registration lifecycle, providing a predictable experience for both developers and users.

## Best Practices

- **Feature Enums**: Define unique identifiers for your features in `pkg/props` or a shared constants package to avoid collisions.
- **Idempotent Setup**: Ensure that `IsConfigured` accurately reflects the state of the configuration to avoid re-prompting users for information they've already provided.
- **Asset Integration**: If your feature requires default configuration values, include them in an `assets/init/config.yaml` file within your feature's package and register it as an asset.
