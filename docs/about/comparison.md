# Framework Comparison

To understand where **Go Tool Base (GTB)** fits in the Go ecosystem, it helps to compare it directly to existing command-line routing libraries and utility frameworks.

## The Feature Grid

This grid compares GTB against the most common tools developers consider when starting a new CLI project in Go.

| Feature / Capability | `flag` (stdlib) | Cobra + Viper | `urfave/cli` | **GTB** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Command Routing** | Manual | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Built-in |
| **Nested Subcommands** | ❌ None | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| **Config File Loading** | Manual | Manual (Viper API) | ❌ None | ✅ Built-in |
| **Asset Embedding** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ `Props.Assets` |
| **Auto-Updating** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ `update` command |
| **Version Syncing (VCS)** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ `version` command |
| **TUI Documentation** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ `docs` command |
| **AI Question & Answer** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ `docs ask` |

## Narrative Comparisons

### GTB vs. Cobra & Viper

**Cobra** is an industry-standard library for parsing and routing CLI commands. **Viper** manages configuration loading. Both are phenomenal libraries—in fact, **GTB uses both Cobra and Viper internally**. 

**The Difference:** If you use Cobra and Viper directly, you are essentially buying the raw materials to build a house. You still have to figure out how to wire Viper's configuration into Cobra's commands securely, how to structure your files, how to implement auto-updates across multiple OS architectures, and how to distribute documentation. 

**GTB is the fully built house.** It provides a heavily structured, opinionated implementation of the Cobra command router seamlessly integrated with Viper. It gives you the destination—the unified `Props` container, the filesystem abstractions (`afero`), the unified logger abstraction (with charmbracelet as the default backend), and the AI service layer—pre-wired and ready for production logic.

### GTB vs. urfave/cli

`urfave/cli` is a fantastic, lightweight CLI framework for Go. It is excellent for simple, single-purpose utilities.

**The Difference:** GTB goes far beyond routing. `urfave/cli` does not provide an application lifecycle, embedded assets, robust configuration management from multiple sources, or native AI integrations. GTB is built for complex, enterprise-grade developer tooling that requires a comprehensive "Micro-RAD" scaffolding approach.

### GTB vs. The Go Standard Library (`flag`)

The Go standard library's `flag` package operates globally, lacks built-in support for nested subcommands without complex hackery, and requires entirely manual implementation for features like ENV var overrides or configuration file parsing. `flag` is appropriate for 50-line single-file scripts; GTB is built for long-living, team-maintained software products.

## The "Wrong Comparisons" (What GTB is NOT)

External developers frequently attempt to categorize GTB alongside standard HTTP or full-stack web frameworks. **These are incorrect comparisons that fundamentally misunderstand GTB's architecture.**

- ❌ **Gin, Echo, Fiber, Chi** — These are HTTP server routers. While a GTB application could optionally start a Gin server inside a command, GTB itself is not a web router.
- ❌ **Buffalo, Beego, Revel, Bud** — These are full-stack MVC/Web frameworks (like Rails or Laravel). They dictate HTTP handlers, frontend templating, and proprietary ORMs. 
- ❌ **PocketBase, Supabase** — These are embedded Backends-as-a-Service (BaaS).
- ❌ **Go-Blueprint, Sponge** — These tools scaffold web microservices specifically. GTB scaffolds general-purpose tools, primarily aimed at CLI interfaces.
- ❌ **Air, Realize** — These are live-reload build watchers. They orchestrate your `go build` loop during development. They are highly complementary to GTB scaffolding but do not compete with it.
