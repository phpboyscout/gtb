Register custom diagnostic checks so `doctor` validates your feature's health alongside the built-in checks.

!!! important
    **Doctor checks are read-only diagnostics.**
    They must not modify state. Return a `setup.CheckResult` describing what was found.

## Step 1: Write your check functions

Each check receives a `context.Context` and `*props.Props` and returns a `setup.CheckResult`.

```go
package myfeature

import (
    "context"

    "github.com/phpboyscout/go-tool-base/pkg/props"
    "github.com/phpboyscout/go-tool-base/pkg/setup"
)

func checkMyService(_ context.Context, props *props.Props) setup.CheckResult {
    endpoint := props.Config.GetString("myfeature.endpoint")
    if endpoint == "" {
        return setup.CheckResult{
            Name:    "My Service",
            Status:  "warn",
            Message: "endpoint not configured",
        }
    }

    // Perform a health check...
    return setup.CheckResult{
        Name:    "My Service",
        Status:  "pass",
        Message: "reachable at " + endpoint,
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Register checks via the feature registry

Use `setup.RegisterChecks` in your package's `init()` block. The `CheckProvider` function receives `*props.Props` and returns a slice of `setup.CheckFunc`, allowing you to conditionally include checks based on configuration.

```go
package myfeature

import (
    "github.com/phpboyscout/go-tool-base/pkg/props"
    "github.com/phpboyscout/go-tool-base/pkg/setup"
)

func init() {
    setup.RegisterChecks(props.FeatureCmd("myfeature"),
        []setup.CheckProvider{
            func(p *props.Props) []setup.CheckFunc {
                return []setup.CheckFunc{
                    checkMyService,
                }
            },
        },
    )
}
```

## Step 3: Import your package

As with initialisers, ensure your package is imported somewhere in the dependency graph — typically via a blank import in your command package:

```go
package command

import (
    _ "github.com/myorg/mytool/pkg/setup/myfeature"
)
```

When the feature is enabled via `props.Tool.IsEnabled()`, the doctor command will automatically discover and run your checks.

## Combining with Initialisers

If your feature already has an initialiser, you can register checks in the same `init()` block:

```go
func init() {
    setup.Register(props.FeatureCmd("myfeature"),
        []setup.InitialiserProvider{...},
        []setup.SubcommandProvider{...},
        []setup.FeatureFlag{...},
    )

    setup.RegisterChecks(props.FeatureCmd("myfeature"),
        []setup.CheckProvider{
            func(p *props.Props) []setup.CheckFunc {
                return []setup.CheckFunc{checkMyService}
            },
        },
    )
}
```

## Status Constants

Use the following status strings in your `CheckResult`:

| Status   | Meaning                           |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `"pass"` | Check succeeded                   |
| `"warn"` | Non-fatal issue, feature may work |
| `"fail"` | Critical problem                  |
| `"skip"` | Check not applicable              |

!!! tip
    Look at the built-in checks in `pkg/cmd/doctor/checks.go` for reference implementations.
