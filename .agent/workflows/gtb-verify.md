description: Library verification suite for GTB

// turbo-all
1. Run the complete library test suite:
   ```bash
   just test
   ```
2. Verify concurrency safety with the race detector:
   ```bash
   just test-race
   ```
3. Run the linter and enforce strict quality rules:
   ```bash
   just lint-fix
   ```
   If any issues remain after `--fix`, resolve them following the `/gtb-lint` workflow before continuing.
4. **Confirm tests still pass after any linting or refactoring changes.** Structural fixes (nestif, cyclop) can silently alter behaviour — always re-run the test suite as the final step after lint work, not just before it.
5. Regenerate mocks if any interfaces were modified:
   ```bash
   just mocks
   ```
6. Verify that no `//nolint` decorators were added unnecessarily.
7. Ensure test coverage for new library features in `pkg/` is at least 90%.
